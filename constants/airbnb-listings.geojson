Best bakeries for a good genuine French baguette :  1) AU 140, the most famous. 140 Rue de Belleville, 75020 Paris. A bit expensive but it's worth it, sometimes, there is a queue in the street. This is my weekend treat. 2) LA BELLEVILLOISE, the nearest and the cheapest. La Bellevilloise, 80 rue de Belleville 75020. The baguette is perfectly decent. \"La traditionnelle\" and their nuts bread are also good. This is where I take my everyday baguette. But don't take the croissants or pains au chocolat, they're not good. 3) GR\u00c9GORY DESFOUX, the youngest one. Between the cheap Bellevilloi",

We help owners and renters, before, during and after their arrival. \r\nI love meeting new people, wherever I meet them, to talk about their culture, their life, their city, their travels.\r\nI travel myself quite a lot, having always funny and great experiences (Lapland in winter with no electricity and water, round trip in US and Canada - balloon fiesta festival, opera in Seattle,\u2026). Travels help me to realize how lucky I am, to get out of my comfort zone, to learn new languages and culture, and to be more humble and empathic to people. I realize also when I get back home how much I miss fresh baguette and salted butter. \r\n3 mottos :\r\nThere is a will, there is a way. \r\nWe can serious things without taking ourselves seriously.\r\nA good day is a day with laughs.\r\n\r\nHope we will have the pleasure to meet !\r\n--\r\nJe fais depuis 2008 de l'intendance et de la conciergerie dans l'immobilier touristique. Oui ? Nous aidons les propri\u00e9taires \u00e0 louer leur appartement et j'aide les locataires avant, pendant et apr\u00e8s leur arriv\u00e9e.\r\nJ'adore rencontrer de nouvelles personnes tout le temps, qui parlent de leur culture, leur ville, pourquoi ils viennent ici, o\u00f9 ils ont voyag\u00e9. \r\nJ'essaye moi-m\u00eame de voyager le plus possible. En dehors de me permettre de respirer, \u00e7a me permet de mieux comprendre les besoins et requ\u00eates des autres voyageurs, avec beaucoup plus d'empathie.\r\nJe me suis aper\u00e7ue que je suis p\u00e9trie d'habitudes et que je peux difficilement me passer de beurre sal\u00e9 avec du pain frais et du lait d'avoine.\r\n3 devises : \r\nThere's a will, there's a way.\r\nOn peut faire les choses s\u00e9rieusement sans se prendre au s\u00e9rieux.\r\nUne bonne journ\u00e9e est une journ\u00e9e o\u00f9 l'on a rit.",

But during the last 10-15 years it has had a complete 'makeover' and is now an extremely popular place to live for students, young families and creative people. Some people complain that the area has become too 'nice and clean' but I think there's a still a lot of old school-charm here. There are both elegant wine bars and smelly pubs with pool tables. Boutiques filled with minimalist Danish design and weird little second-hand shops. Kebabs are available everywhere - along with organic, vegetarian take-aways. Vesterbro is a place where people live - go to school or work, go out for groceries, have coffee with friends, take their dog for a stroll. It has a 'villagey' feel, but at the same time it's so close to the central part of the city, the airport - and even the beach.",

There are shops and restaurant in walking distance. Easy to park a car during the night (but you can't stay more than 2 hours during the day). Bus stop in front of the building, subway and train station 5 minutes away (Schuman)",

I lived in Huancavelica in the Peruvian Andes for four years when I was a child and since then I seem to be in love with mountains, no matter where they are. I got used to travelling from a young age, the globe trotter blood runs in the family! I travelled in South America visiting different parts of Peru and  Bolivia, and small bits of Chile, Brazil and Paraguay. I moved to the UK in 2001 and while living in London I have done quite a few trips. My highlights are trekking in the Wakhan corridor between Pakistan and Afghanistan; going to Tizi Ouzou, Algeria, a trip with mum and a few uncles and a great auntie to Rajasthan, camping and trekking in Romania, etc, etc, etc. I love culture in its different expressions: languages, food, dance, films, books, art. To keep stress free I do sports: cycling every day to and from work, dancing in my small leaving room, teaching Zumba and walking around unless the weather is too horrible in which case I revert to cooking, baking and reading. I might (or not?) be stating the obvious here: I like travelling and Airbnb seems like a very nice accommodation option.",

We help owners and renters, before, during and after their arrival. \r\nI love meeting new people, wherever I meet them, to talk about their culture, their life, their city, their travels.\r\nI travel myself quite a lot, having always funny and great experiences (Lapland in winter with no electricity and water, round trip in US and Canada - balloon fiesta festival, opera in Seattle,\u2026). Travels help me to realize how lucky I am, to get out of my comfort zone, to learn new languages and culture, and to be more humble and empathic to people. I realize also when I get back home how much I miss fresh baguette and salted butter. \r\n3 mottos :\r\nThere is a will, there is a way. \r\nWe can serious things without taking ourselves seriously.\r\nA good day is a day with laughs.\r\n\r\nHope we will have the pleasure to meet !\r\n--\r\nJe fais depuis 2008 de l'intendance et de la conciergerie dans l'immobilier touristique.

En dehors de me permettre de respirer, \u00e7a me permet de mieux comprendre les besoins et requ\u00eates des autres voyageurs, avec beaucoup plus d'empathie.\r\nJe me suis aper\u00e7ue que je suis p\u00e9trie d'habitudes et que je peux difficilement me passer de beurre sal\u00e9 avec du pain frais et du lait d'avoine.\r\n3 devises : \r\nThere's a will, there's a way.\r\nOn peut faire les choses s\u00e9rieusement sans se prendre au s\u00e9rieux.\r\nUne bonne journ\u00e9e est une journ\u00e9e o\u00f9 l'on a rit.",

             "description":"Large apartment 145 m2 with a private garden and a terrace, in a Liberty Art Nouveau villa, at the center of Lido, 5 minutes away from the beaches and 15 minutes from Saint-Mark's Square. The apartment is located in an Art Nouveau - Liberty style - villa built around 1910 at the center of Lido. It is close to the beaches and abotu 15 minutes away to Piazza San Marco at the very heart of Venice. This situation is a key advantage, as it is possible both to visit this  great Art city which is Venice with its monuments and to enjoy a sea vacation on the nearby Adriatic beaches.

             "neighborhood_overview":"The Lido has kept an unique turn-of-the-century, charm, with a lot of 1900 villas dominated by large Edwardian style hotels such as the Excelsior and the Des Bains. This cosmopolitan atmosphere, still alive,  is well described in Luigi Visconti's movie \"Death in Venice\" (from Thomas Mann's novel) or in Lord Norwich's book \"Paradise of cities\" or in some Dona Leon's crime stories.  In summer time, the Lido is a sea-side town, with crowded sandy beaches, five minutes away in vaporetto from the historical heart of Venice. In spring time, it is a perfect place where to rest after  strolling Venice.",

             "transit":"The Lido is well deserved by public transport as it is connected to: - the airport with a vaporetto each half hour - the trip lasts about an hour. - Venice with a vaporetto each 8 minutes during daytime and each 20 minutes during the night, from 23.00 to 5.00; - the mainland - through Jesolo and Punta Sabbioni each hour. It is also possible to drive, although you would need to take the ferry at the Tronchetto terminal in Venice. There is a network of bus, bringing people to the  secluded Murazzi beaches and to Pallestrina along the coast. It is also easy to rent bikes (including tandem) to explore this golden island.",

This cosmopolitan atmosphere, still alive, is well described in Luigi Visconti's movie \"Death in Venice\" (from Thomas Mann's novel) or in Lord Norwich's book \"Paradise of cities\" or in some Dona Leon's crime stories. In summer time, the Lido is a sea-side town, with crowded sandy beaches, five minutes away in vaporetto from the historical heart of Venice. In spring time, it is a perfect place where to rest after strolling Venice.",

It is also possible to drive, although you would need to take the ferry at the Tronchetto terminal in Venice. There is a network of bus, bringing people to the secluded Murazzi beaches and to Pallestrina along the coast. It is also easy to rent bikes (including tandem) to explore this golden island.",

Enjoy all cuisines. \r\n\r\nI live in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, known for its great socio-economic & racial & religious diversity.  My 44-sq meter apartment was entirely renovated in 2009, has modern open kitchen with bar, double exposure (lots of light!), offers a lovely skyline view of central Paris, and a queen-size Tempurpedic mattress for good sleep. It is conveniently located less than 5 mins from metro (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, line 11) and is across the street from a large Park (Buttes Chaumont.) The Buttes Chaumont park is perfect for picnics, jogs, kids, and a trendy adult bar (Rosa Bonheur - open all week, Saturday is very crowded straight afternoon\/evening, Sunday is the gay afternoon\/evening and one of best gay destinations all week in Paris. If going to Rosa Bonheur bar on weekend arrive by 4pm to avoid waiting in line, then picnic and tapas and drink to your heart's content!) There are fun restaurants in the area : French, Columbian, Argentinian, Thai, Moroccan, Algerian, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, etc! The rue de Belleville (3min walk) As a host, I want my guests to have a fantastic time and have plenty of ideas for my neighborhood. \r\n\r\nAs a traveler I prefer to stay in a real home vs hotel, what is real local life like (local restaurants\/bars\/destinations) and am very respectful of the host's home.",

We help owners and renters, before, during and after their arrival. \r\nI love meeting new people, wherever I meet them, to talk about their culture, their life, their city, their travels.\r\nI travel myself quite a lot, having always funny and great experiences (Lapland in winter with no electricity and water, round trip in US and Canada - balloon fiesta festival, opera in Seattle,\u2026). Travels help me to realize how lucky I am, to get out of my comfort zone, to learn new languages and culture, and to be more humble and empathic to people.

It is like a global village where all nationalities rub shoulders and live in  (URL HIDDEN) remains a predominantly African quarter: you passe from Mali to Cameroon, Senegal to Morocco, Ghana to Algeria on every street corner and all this at the foot of Montmartre and the Sacre Coeur! Our neighborhood is full of typical small shops: fabrics, wigs, hairdressers, dressmakers .. a journey of several thousand kilometers by pushing the door of a single shop! In addition, like all Paris, we can not escape the phenomenon of gentrification: As in Brooklyn appear here many small restaurants, cafes, organic shops and  stylists. We also have several very popular markets and organic food cooperative and an excellent bakery with very good croissants just down the building. In short: a lively and sparkling neighborhood where it's good to stay!",

I grew up speaking French, then added English, Spanish, and a smattering of Italian. I am a resident physician (aka registrar) in surgery currently working in Oakland, CA, the Baltimore of the West Coast. \r\n\r\nI love to travel, explore new places, and get more familiar with places that I already know. When I travel, I alternate between beach trips, city trips, and road trips (have crossed the US 3 times with my darling dog Boo Radley).\r\n\r\nI like to cook and enjoy all kinds of cuisine. I'm down to earth and mellow. I like to go to museums, the theater, movies, and eating good food!",

This neighborhood is consistently ranked  #1 for the best, most affordable, and most innovative restaurants! (I send all guests a detailed list of my favorite nearby eating establishments) There's a great gym with a pool just next door.

Then an astoundingly good diner either Le Chateaubriand or Pierre Sang followed by a romantic stroll down the Canal St. Martin, and if you've still got energy, drinks at Chez Josephine or the more mellow Au Chat Noir, followed by an obligatory 2:00 am street cr\u00eape!",

But we're going to say obviously, East Harlem\/Spanish Harlem pride is the most deserved. It is an incredibly diverse neighborhood. It is predominantly Hispanic, you can get around without ever having to speak English here. We have the best Mexican food here though, nobody is even going to argue that one. There are delicious Peruvian, Dominican, Cuban, Argentinean and Caribbean restaurants all close by too. If you like Italian there's a really amazing spot 2 blocks away and if you can manage to get a table the famous Rao's is at the end of our block. The best pizza in the city is 3 blocks up 1st Ave, (best pizza if you are into the classic thin crust coal fired brick oven pizza). There is soul food all over the place up here. And about 10 blocks up in the heart of central Harlem there are some really amazing upscale dining spots, some French, African (Sengalese and Mo",

The collection of fitness related stuff is ever expanding and accessible to guests.

If you like to do yoga, you won't be looked at funny here! There is a Planet Fitness 2 blocks away, if you're a member, it's a new one and still pretty nice, if you're not a member but want to join we are permitted guests so if you want to go when we go, let's coordinate. Our dance studio has an open Latin dance social on Friday nights too and you're welcome to join us if that interests you. I think it's 10 entry for non members. If you are",
